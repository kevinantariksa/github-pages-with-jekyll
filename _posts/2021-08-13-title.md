Replace the YYYY-MM-DD with today's date, and change the title of your first blog post if you'd like. Note: If you do edit the title, make sure there are hyphens between your words.

If your blog post date doesn't follow the correct date convention, you'll receive an error and your site won't build. For more information, see "Page build failed: Invalid post date".
